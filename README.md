## Usage

Click on points on the grid to begin drawing lines. Complete the polygon by connecting the final point to the starting point.

Once the polygon is formed, an SVG code snippet will be displayed in the bottom-left corner of the web application for easy copying. Additionally, you can upload an image, which will be masked using the generated polygon.
